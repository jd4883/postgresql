# Auto-release on merge to main: bump patch version, create tag and release.
# One repo, three charts (operator/, cluster/, backup-to-minio/). Trigger on any chart or README change.
# Uses reusable action from github-actions repo. Requires: default branch is main; tags exist as v* (e.g. v0.1.0).
# Do NOT include .github/** so workflow-only changes do not trigger a release.
